# Synthetic_Seismogram
In reflection seismology, synthetic seismogram is based on convolution theory. Seismograms are very important tool for seismic interpretation where they work as a bridge between well and surface seismic data. In this post, I have tried to show how we can implement this task in some lines of code with real data in python.
